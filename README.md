This theme overwrites the default container (contextual identity) colors for containers in Firefox. It alters the tab highlight color and the icon and name color in the url bar. 

It does not change the colors shown in the preferences menu in Firefox. It also does not alter [multi-account containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) add on
